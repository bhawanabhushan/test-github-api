QA Automation Test for GitHub API

## Pre-requisites

`node.js` and `npm` are required to test the project. Also, install pnpm for better overall experience

```sh
npm i pnpm -g
```

> *Note - `pnpm` is the recommended as it is much faster, however, the project also works with `npm` out of the box.*

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

    ```sh
    pnpm i
    ```

## Steps to test

1. Run test cases

    ```sh
    pnpm test
    ```
